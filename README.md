# A/B Test: Hyper Island Data Analyst Program Page Engagement

This repository contains the experiment design and analysis for an A/B test aimed at improving the engagement rate on Hyper Island's Data Analyst Program page. The current problem is that only 25% of visitors scroll down past the hero section, and we aim to increase this figure. This project includes hypotheses, experiment designs, and pre-analysis for the A/B test.

## Experiment Design

The experiment will test the Control (A) vs. the Treatment (B) version of the page. Below is the structure of the A/B test:

### Control (A):
The current version of the landing page with the existing hero section, CTA, and content.

### Treatment (B):
A revised version with changes to the hero section to improve engagement, such as partial visibility of the content below the hero section. This change is expected to entice visitors to scroll down further.

## Pre-Analysis

- **Estimated Uplift**: Based on previous tests and assumptions, we expect a 15-40% increase in scroll-down rates.
- **Sample Size**: The sample size is calculated to ensure statistical significance for the expected uplift. Based on our assumptions and previous traffic data, we need a minimum of [X] participants per variant to achieve power â‰¥ 80% and a confidence level of 95%.
- **Test Duration**: The test is expected to run for [X] weeks to gather sufficient data for statistical significance. The duration will be based on traffic data, which is estimated to be [X] visits per week.
  
## A/B Test Autopsy

After conducting the A/B test, we will evaluate its effectiveness by analyzing the results, including statistical significance, user behavior, and possible improvements for future tests. The following questions will be addressed:

1. Did the Treatment version outperform the Control version in terms of scroll-down rate and overall engagement metrics (e.g., bounce rate, time on page)?
2. Were the costs of implementing the Treatment version (e.g., design and development) worth the expected uplift in engagement?
3. How can we refine our hypotheses and experiment design based on the results?

## Success Metrics

- Primary: Scroll-down rate (percentage of visitors who scroll past the hero section).
- Secondary: Conversion rate, time on page, engagement (clicks, interactions with the content), bounce rate.

## Statistical Analysis

- We will use statistical methods, to determine the significance of differences between Control and Treatment versions.
- We will ensure a significance threshold of 95% (p < 0.05) for the primary metric.

## Risks and Assumptions

- Assumption: Traffic patterns will remain consistent during the testing period.
- Risk: External factors such as marketing campaigns or seasonal trends may skew the results.
